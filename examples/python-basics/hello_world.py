Hello World - Your first Python program

This is the simplest Python program. It demonstrates:
- The print() function
- String literals
- Comments

Run with: python hello_world.py
"""

# This is a comment - Python ignores it
# Use comments to explain your code

# The print() function outputs text to the console
print("Hello, World!")

# You can print multiple things
print("Welcome to Python!")
print("Let's learn together.")

# You can also use variables
name = "AI Learner"
year = 2026

# f-strings let you embed variables in strings
print(f"Hello, {name}! Welcome to {year}.")

# Try these exercises:
# 1. Change the name variable to your name
# 2. Add another print statement with your favorite quote
# 3. Calculate and print your age in 10 years

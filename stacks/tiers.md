## Your Current Tier

**Level**: Beginner
**Active Tier**: Tier 1 only

### What This Means

- Focus on foundational technologies
- Master Python, SQL, and basic libraries
- Build strong fundamentals before advancing
- No pressure to learn advanced tools

### Upgrading

You can upgrade to Intermediate (Tier 1 + 2) when:
- Completing Tier 1 curriculum
- Scoring 90%+ for 4 consecutive weeks
- Explicitly requesting upgrade

---

## Technology Selection Guide

### When Choosing Tools

1. **Start simple** - Use the simplest tool that works
2. **Learn why** - Understand when to upgrade
3. **Depth over breadth** - Master few tools well
4. **Production focus** - Learn what you'll actually use

### Common Paths

**Data Science Path**:
Python → Pandas → Scikit-learn → PyTorch

**ML Engineering Path**:
Python → FastAPI → Docker → PyTorch → Ray

**Full-Stack AI Path**:
Python → Flask → React → LangChain → Vercel
